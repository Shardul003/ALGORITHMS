AZURE APPROACH
  1. The "No-Azure" Workaround (User-Based Auth)
Since I do not have permissions to register an application in the Azure Portal, I have pivoted the technical approach to use Delegated User Permissions.

How it works: Instead of the system logging in as an "App," it uses my existing Power BI login.

The Tool: I can use the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) in Python or PowerShell.
  


Method A: Low-Code Automation (Power Automate)
This is the most efficient path for scheduled, repeatable extractions.

Action: Use the "HTTP with Microsoft Entra ID" connector.

The "Secret Sauce": This connector is "pre-authorized." It uses my current login to generate the required "Bearer Token" automatically.

Endpoint: POST https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/groups/{workspaceId}/datasets/{datasetId}/executeQueries

Method B: Scripted Extraction (PowerShell)This is the best path for bulk scanning across multiple workspaces.
Action: Utilize the MicrosoftPowerBIMgmt module.Workflow:Install-Module -Name MicrosoftPowerBIMgmtLogin-PowerBIServiceAccount (Triggers a standard O365 login popup).Run Get-PowerBITable -DatasetId <id> to list all tables programmatically.
Benefit: Allows us to loop through every workspace I have access to and export a full "Data Dictionary" to CSV in minutes.
